Container Links is use to a container talk to another container


example:
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --link sourceContainer recipientContainer:v0.1
//recipientContainer can be http(api) container
//sourceContainer can be database container

docker exec -it [recipientContainer hash] bash
more /etc/hosts
//then we will see the sourceContainer name and ip
ping [sourceContainer]


docker inspect [sourceContainer hash] | grep ip
// we will see the ip is as same as the one in recipientContainer /etc/hosts
